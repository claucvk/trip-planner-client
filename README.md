# Trip Planner
### By: Claudia Vargas

## Welcome to my Project!
This is an app that intend to help people to plan trips. It allows you to save and organize the information needed to plan successfully a trip. You can find different fields to register the information and a map (in the future) to help you to choose the right place to go and the transportation available.
